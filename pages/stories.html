      <div class="col-lg-8">Honestly probably the greatest thing ever! My life is changed now. So I really like the way Baking night is organized.
			Its just such a good way to meet people. I feel like its a very inclusive event. It gives me time to spend with my friends so we have something to do
		and then we get a sweet reward at the end. Because who doesn't like to eat ;) - Josh</div>

      <div class="col-lg-8">For me baking night provided an opportunity to bond with my friends and coworkers in a meaningful and light hearted way. It was
				incredibly valuable to be able to create something together. It was so much fun for us! 10/10 would recommend - Nathan</div>

      <div class="col-lg-8">My favorite part about baking night was the quality of the desserts. I was nervous that the recipes wouldn't deliver on the
			quality that they promised, because it is so high, or that I wouldn't be able to perform on the more difficult recipes but they delivered. An opportunity
		 to learn more baking skills and get an incredible dish and I felt like I couldn't mess it up.</div>

			have to recommend that even if just for that purpose. So much fun!</div>

      <div class="col-lg-8">I tried baking night because a friend recommended it. I had been looking to develop a new skill and that is what I found. It is
			 often sold as an idea for social gatherings but I have been doing it by myself and I still love it. It feels like I have culinary school brought
		 straight to my door once a week.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-8">I think that it is definetly worth giving it a try. We have had 3 boxes delivered now and each time seems to be better than the
			last. It's been really good to use for me as I run a preschool and the kids love the chance to make their own treat. We order simple boxes and they feel
		involved get a nice treat and it is something we will keep using. </div>

      <div class="col-lg-8">This service saved my mind during quarantine. I heard lots of people were making bread to fill the time, but my bread just wouldn't
			turn out. That's when a friend told me about Baking Night. Once I gave it a try I knew there was no going back. Home made has always been important to me,
		but I've never been a good baker. The fact I can make complicated desserts that impress my friends has made Baking Night one of my best purchases. </div>
